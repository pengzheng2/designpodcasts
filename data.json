Not necessarily the stories you hear from the stage, but ones you get when you actually have a conversation with someone. We want to have conversations not only with the presenters and people hosting workshops, but the vendors and attendees. We also want to talk to other creative people, not just the designers, illustrators, and photographers, but the developers, writers, musicians, comedians, chefs and anyone else that uses their creative talent. It's not about being from the South, that's just where we live!",
